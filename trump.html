    <h1>Cassidy Hutchinson</h1>
    <p>“I've never voted for a Democrat in my life, but I would absolutely consider voting for Joe Biden this upcoming November because he will not seek to destroy our nation. He will not seek to destroy our Constitution,” she said. Hutchinson's statement does not come lightly.</p>

    <h1>Stephanie Grisham</h1>
    <p>Stephanie Grisham worked on Trump’s 2016 campaign before becoming White House press secretary and later first lady Melania Trump’s chief of staff, told The Washington Post in November that she fears Trump will again win the White House.</p>
    <p>In a March CNN interview, Grisham offered to help Democrats with debate prep if Biden and Trump agree to face off.</p>
    <p>“I spent six years nonstop with Donald Trump, and I’ll tell you what: If Biden does decide to debate Trump, I would sure like to prep President Biden,” she said.</p>

    <h1>Sarah Matthews</h1>
    <p>Former deputy White House press secretary, supported Nikki Haley in the Republican primaries. She told The Post, however, that if her choice is between Trump and Biden on Election Day, she’ll support Biden.</p>
    <p>“We can survive bad policy from a second Biden administration,” Matthews said, “but I don’t think we can survive a second Trump term, in terms of our democracy.”</p>

    <h1>Alyssa Farah Griffin</h1>
    <p>Former White House communications director</p>
    <p>Alyssa Farah Griffin, who served as a White House communication director for Trump in 2020 and is now a host for ABC’s “The View” and a CNN commentator, told The Post last month that Trump “is a threat to democracy, and I will never support him.”</p>
    <p>Farah Griffin hasn’t ruled out supporting Biden, but says she hasn’t made that decision yet.</p>
    <p>“If Joe Biden remains where he’s been on aid to Ukraine and support for Israel, it’ll be much easier to get there,” she says of Republicans, like herself, who are considering supporting him."</p>

    <h1>Liz Cheney</h1>
    <p>"Trump was the only president in American history who failed to fulfill his obligation to guarantee the peaceful transfer of power, the only president who has ever attempted to overturn an election and seize power…(and) the only president in American history who sent an armed and angry mob to the Capitol to attempt corruptly to stop the official proceeding of the count of electoral votes, and then watched on television for hours as the mob attacked.”</p>
    <p>“It may be the last real vote you cast”</p>

    <h1>John Bolton</h1>
    <p>John Bolton, who served as Trump’s national security adviser from 2018 to 2019 repeatedly said he will not support the former president in November.</p>
    <p>Still, Bolton said he will not vote for Biden. He will write in a candidate in November.</p>
    <p>“I live in Maryland. So, Biden is going to carry that state anyway,” Bolton told CNN in March. “What I think the priority has to be for … Republicans who don’t like Trump, is get a Republican Senate. And in Maryland, we have a real opportunity with former governor Larry Hogan. I’m going to spend a lot of time on that.”</p>
    <p>Bolton, who wrote a book that was sharply critical of Trump on national security after leaving the White House, said he’s frustrated by how Trump critics have been unsuccessful in hurting the former president’s popularity.</p>
    <p>“So many things that I thought would be telling arguments about Trump — his character, you name it — have proven ineffective,” Bolton said. “The only thing that’s left is Trump’s not fit to be president. He doesn’t have a conservative philosophy. He follows his own personal interest, and that’s not what you need in a president.”</p>

    <h1>Ty Cobb</h1>
    <p>Ty Cobb, who was once a Trump loyalist and as White House counsel defended the former president during the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election, has repeatedly said that the country cannot elect Trump again.</p>
    <p>“He has never cared about America, its citizens, its future or anything but himself,” Cobb wrote in an email to The Post last year. “In fact, as history well shows from his divisive lies, as well as from his unrestrained contempt for the rule of law and his related crimes, his conduct and mere existence have hastened the demise of democracy and of the nation.”</p>
    <p>Cobb added that America’s adversaries and allies “both recognize that even his potential reelection diminishes America on the world stage and ensures continued acceleration of the domestic decline we are currently enduring.”</p>
    <p>“If that reelection actually happens, the consequences will extinguish what, if anything, remains of the American Dream,” Cobb wrote.</p>
    <p>In a separate interview with The Post published last month, Cobb said he would vote for Biden.</p>
    <p>“If the time comes and a vote for Joe is required to stop Trump, then I’d grudgingly vote for Biden,” Cobb said.</p>

    <h1>Mick Mulvaney</h1>
    <p>Before Trump emerged victorious from the early GOP primaries, Mick Mulvaney, another of Trump’s chiefs of staff, told NBC News that he did not want his former boss to win the nomination.</p>
    <p>“I am working hard to make sure that someone else is the nominee,” Mulvaney said. “I think he’s the Republican who is most likely to lose in a general election, of all our leading candidates. If anyone can lose to Joe Biden, it would be him.”</p>
    <p>And, in a May interview with Australian network Sky News, Mulvaney said that, if Trump were to win the GOP primary, “he will probably lose” the general election.</p>
    <p>Mulvaney hasn’t said who he will vote for in November. But he’s been critical of Biden and his campaign, saying last week that former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton outshined Biden at a fundraiser that Biden’s campaign said brought in more than $26 million. Mulvaney also penned an op-ed for the Hill about Biden’s age in February.</p>
    <p>In a separate op-ed published by the Hill that same month, Mulvaney pushed for a third-party ticket, arguing that there is a “general displeasure amongst the electorate with the idea of” a Biden-Trump rematch.</p>

    <h1>William P. Barr</h1>
    <p>While former attorney general William P. Barr — who split from Trump after the Jan. 6 attack — refused to endorse Trump in the GOP’s 2024 presidential primary, he recently suggested that reelecting Biden would be more dangerous than a second Trump term.</p>
    <p>“Voting for Trump is playing Russian roulette with the country,” Barr said in February, according to Axios’s Mike Allen. “Voting for Biden is outright national suicide.”</p>
    <p>Barr’s February statement cleared up any ambiguity Barr had put forth about his view on Biden’s reelection bid after the former attorney general came out against Trump’s campaign last summer.</p>
    <p>“I have made clear that I strongly oppose Trump for the nomination and will not endorse Trump,” Barr told NBC News in a story that published in July. Asked then how he would vote if the general election was a Trump-Biden rematch, Barr said he’d “jump off that bridge when I get to it.”</p>
    <p>Barr has been a sharp critic of the former president since he left his administration. He called Trump’s indictment in connection to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack fair and has argued that the Justice Department has a “legitimate case” against his former boss. Barr has repeatedly said that Trump knew he had lost the 2020 election, despite his claims that the race was stolen from him.</p>

    <h1>John F. Kelly</h1>
    <p>John F. Kelly, the former president’s longest-serving chief of staff, has been among the loudest detractors of a second Trump term.</p>
    <p>In a November interview with The Post, Kelly said he was watching his former boss dominate the Republican primary field with increasing despair.</p>
    <p>“What’s going on in the country that a single person thinks this guy would still be a good president when he’s said the things he’s said and done the things he’s done?” Kelly said. “It’s beyond my comprehension he has the support he has.”</p>
    <p>A retired four-star general, Kelly said he doesn’t know what to do to change people’s minds about their support for Trump. He cited a statement he issued to CNN in October 2023 confirming comments Trump made privately years ago about veterans and the war-wounded.</p>
    <p>“I came out and told people the awful things he said about wounded soldiers, and it didn’t have half a day’s bounce,” he told The Post last year. “You had his attorney general Bill Barr come out, and not a half a day’s bounce. If anything, his numbers go up. It might even move the needle in the wrong direction. I think we’re in a dangerous zone in our country.”</p>

    <h1>Andrew McCabe</h1>
    <p>"‘I don’t feel free': McCabe expects to remain Trump target after winning back pension"</p>
    <p>Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe said Thursday he expects to remain a political target of former President Donald Trump despite winning back his full pension as part of a legal settlement with the federal government after his firing during the Trump administration.</p>
    <p>McCabe was fired in March 2018 by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions after the Justice Department’s inspector general determined he had misled internal investigators about his involvement in a news media leak. His termination came just hours before he entered retirement, leaving him without pension.</p>
    <p>McCabe sued in 2019, saying his firing was an effort by Trump to purge the FBI of officials he saw as disloyal. McCabe became acting director of the FBI after Trump fired James Comey, who was leading an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.</p>

    <h1>James Comey</h1>
    <p>“Serious for the Justice Department and the FBI, because Trump is coming for those institutions. He knows their power, and I think he has regrets that he didn’t work hard enough to corrupt them last time,” the former FBI official said. “So, he’s coming for them, and that’s a danger for all Americans.”</p>
    <p>“He’s going to put people in positions in those organizations. He didn’t have all-stars the last time. He’ll have the bottom of the barrel this time, but people who will want to do his will — and that should worry every American,” he added. “This election matters because of a reason like that.”</p>

    <h1>Anthony Scaramucci</h1>
    <p>When asked about what the incumbent should do to garner those voters, Scaramucci offered Biden willed Biden to say “‘Hey, this is a binary election, this is democracy first. Are you a patriot first and a partisan last? Come join us so that we can keep this system of government, this great American experiment working for the American people as well as it’s worked over the last 250 years."</p>
    <p>Scaramucci was not the only one to criticize Haley’s subtle endorsement of Trump.</p>

    <h1>Michael Steele</h1>
    <p>"And I am voting for Joe Biden on Nov. 3."</p>
    <p>I was, and am, convinced that conservative principles are the most effective means of empowering people to achieve the American Dream.</p>
    <p>It certainly is not because of political expediency. For me, it never has been. As a teenager growing up in a monolithically Democratic community, I recognized that the values articulated by President Ronald Reagan echoed those of my mother — a sharecropper’s daughter who worked in a laundry. I was, and am, convinced that conservative principles, individual initiative and free enterprise are the most effective means of empowering people to achieve the American Dream.</p>
    <p>As an adult, I worked to advance those principles, first as GOP chair in one of the nation’s most Democratic counties, and, later, as party chair in one of the most Democratic states. I later chaired the Republican National Committee after two of the most devastating election cycles in GOP history.</p>
    <p>An opportunist, I am not.</p>
    <p>Yet, I cannot support the nominee of my party.</p>

    <h1>Gen. Mark Milley</h1>
    <p>"We don’t take an oath to a king or a queen or to a tyrant or a dictator. And we don’t take an oath to a wannabe dictator,” he said. “We don’t take an oath to an individual. We take an oath to the Constitution, and we take an oath to the idea that is America, and we’re willing to die to protect it.”</p>
    <p>Milley is retiring after more than four decades of military service, including multiple combat deployments and two often turbulent years as Joint Chiefs chairman under Trump. And it was those years, and the battles he fought against Trump, that formed much of the underpinning of his farewell address and also were sprinkled throughout other speeches in the ceremony.</p>
